# bbc-offline-hack
BBC hack day - service workers

Notes -
* Pre-fetch top 10
* Cache static files
* Cache timing
* Good caching
* Mark what you would like to cache 
* Figure out what the user likes - cache it

To do -
* Move the cached url's generation to the button onclick
* cache lead image for stories
* To test the "Mark what you would like to cache" we would need uncached content with clickable links (currently whole page is pre-fetched)
